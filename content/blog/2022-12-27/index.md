Hey Everyone,

Our goal is to be a distraction-free text editor, which is fast, simple and widely available. We started with Chromium-based extension. The choice was pretty obvious. Chromium-based browsers have the most people using them â€“ itâ€™s ~65% of all desktop browser users.

We wanted to reach the rest 35%. Next checkpoint on our list is Firefox. Thatâ€™s why a couple of weeks ago we started working on Firefox edition.

With 0.6.5 you can install on Chromium-based browsers (e.g., Opera, Vivaldi, Chrome, Brave) and on Firefox.

It has all, but one, feature available on Chromium. We havenâ€™t figured out how to copy text to clipboard as an image. We have been working on that, we didnâ€™t want to hold the release, and it will be available soon.

The next stop â€“ Safari extension? ðŸ˜‰
