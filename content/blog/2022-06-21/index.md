Hey Everyone,

We have just released a new version of Difree – 0.5.0 – our writing app focused on distraction-free experience when writing. We added an option to:1. export text in Markdown
2. export text in Plain text with some basic formatting

## What’s changed?

Our main focus was to add an option to:
1. export text in Markdown
2. export text in Plain text with some basic formatting

Why? We are the big fans of Reddit! And Reddit has a rather distraction-full text editor. We wanted to fix the experience we have with writing something longer and meaningful on Reddit.  


Here’s how it works:
1. Open Difree
2. Write a post / reply
3. Click a Menu option on Copy button and select ‘Markdown’

4. Paste in Reddit text field

5. Remember to select ‘Markdown Editor’ first
