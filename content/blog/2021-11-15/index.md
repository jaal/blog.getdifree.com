I get easily distracted. Sometimes it takes one second, one though and I am gone for several minutes wandering on Wikipedia pages or YouTube.

When I discovered this technique, I was sceptical. I thought: “How is it possible, something that simple can be that effective? If it’s so good and simple, they should be writting and talking about it!”. And yet it is!

It’s called ‘5 second rule’ by Mel Robbins. Believe me, it’s not about dropping food on the floor, and eating it as long as you pick it up within 5 seconds.

The 5 second rule says:

> If you have an instinct to act on a goal, you must physically move within 5 seconds or your brain will kill it. This rule works for both, acting on a goal or not acting against a goal.

### Example 1 – acting on a goal

I knew I had something important and urgent to do.I kept procrastinating on it…… until I started counting backwards, 5-4-3-2-1The procrastination disappeared and I am ready to go!

### Example 2 – not acting against a goal

I was working on something important.An idea popped into my head – ‘Hey, let’s check what’s new on Reddit’. It was almost irresistable temptation…… until I started counting backward, 5-4-3-2-1The temptation disappeared and I am back again! What do you think about it? Did you know that method? If so, what is your opinion? If not, how about trying?
