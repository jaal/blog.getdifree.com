Hey,
We switched from an internal system to collect usage data (self-hosted Matomo) to an external one (Posthog). We did it because we find it more secure for the people using Difree and more reliable from our perspective.

Nothing has changed from your perspective.
1. You are still the only person who sees and owns the writing. We have never seen it, we are not seeing it, nor we will ever see it.
2. You are in the full control of sharing usage data. It's not turned on by default. To use Difree you have to decide whether you want to send the usage data or not. Once decided, you can always change your mind simply by changing the setup in Settings with one click.


## Changelog
