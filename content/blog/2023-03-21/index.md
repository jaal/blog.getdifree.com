### Hey,

It’s been a while since we released a new version of Difree.  
There’s been a reason for that. We have been working on a different approach.

We designed Difree to have a bottom menu responsible for managing notes and for the actions, such as ‘copy’ or ‘clear’. It seemed to be a good idea at first…

…but most users use in their computers screens, that are 1.77 times wider than taller. According to the StatCounter, the most popular screen resolutions on desktop devices in the last 12 months are:

1. 1920×1080
2. 1366×768
3. 1536×864

This means people probably have fewer vertical space. Our previous design took some of that precious space.

We thought, what if we had moved that menu to the Sidebar? We would have saved some vertical space, which could have given more space for writing.

That has been our priority since the last release. And today we are ready to show off!
