Hey,

We have just released a new version of Difree (0.3.3) – our distraction-free text editor to calmly write meaningful things.

Our main focus has been on improvements in mechanics, usability and bug fixing considering previous release. We then introduced new feature: option to save Notes, so you can work on many things distraction free. It needed some polish.
