Hey,
We just released a new version of Difree (0.3.4) – our distraction-free text editor to calmly write meaningful things.

## What’s changed?
1. Our focus was to make it faster and easier to write.
2. To start writing, just click the right mouse button to open Context Menu and then click the icon of Difree.
3. The Difree opens with a Note created. The Note contains the Title and URL.

## Here’s the scenario,
1. Let’s say you have an e-mail to reply to the post on Reddit (or e-mail on HEY or Gmail).
2. With one click on icon of Difree in context menu (right mouse button) you open Difree and have an empty Note with Title and URL.
3. It works for (almost) every website.

## How to install / update

- Install extension in the browser: [https://i.getdifree.com/install](https://i.getdifree.com/install)
- Update extension to new version: the update should happen automatically when the browser runs. To check, enter Extension section in browser.
